# data_analytics_capstone

## General Overview

This is for my capstone project in the Google Data Analytics Career Certificate! I've included the csv, SQL scripts, and R scripts.

### SQL Files

I wanted to recreate a situation I might encounter in the workplace. To do so, I simply imported the csv file using MySQL Workbench and only using the suggested datatypes. For example, the "start_time" and the "started_at" times in the 2019 and 2020 files were imported as text instead of the more appropriate DATETIME datatype.
